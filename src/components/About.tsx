      <p>
      Hello, im am Henrik Heinonen, nice to meet you here! I am a dedicated and results-driven professional with over 20 years of experience in the chemical process industry, logistics, and shipping operations. Throughout my career, I have honed my expertise in managing complex processes, ensuring the safe and efficient movement of materials, and leading high-performance teams. With a solid background as a Loading Master and in team leadership roles, I am passionate about driving operational excellence, optimizing workflows, and maintaining the highest safety standards.

Having spent about a decade as a Team Leader, I have developed exceptional leadership skills in managing cross-functional teams, fostering collaboration, and providing guidance to achieve company goals. My leadership style emphasizes strong communication, problem-solving, and continuous improvementâ€”all crucial in dynamic and high-pressure environments.

As I transition into the IT industry, I am building on my extensive problem-solving and technical skills by completing a Bachelor's in Computer Science (BSc) and currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science (MSc). I am excited about leveraging my previous experience in leadership and operations management while applying my growing technical knowledge to the dynamic world of IT.

With a strong foundation in managing large-scale operations and teams, I am eager to bring my analytical, technical, and leadership skills to an IT-focused role where I can continue to drive success and innovation.
